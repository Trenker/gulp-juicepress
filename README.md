This is a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task for blog generation using [juicepress](https://github.com/trenker/juicepress)

A fully working example can be seen at <https://github.com/trenker/juicepress-example>

## Installation

Have the `gulp` package already installed and write

```bash
npm install --save gulp-juicepress
```

## Usage

Require the module *gulp-juicepress* and pipe markdown posts to it

```js
var juicepress = require("gulp-juicepress");
var options = {
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000/"
};

gulp.task("juicepress", function() {
  return gulp
    .src("./posts/**/*.md")
    .pipe(juicepress(options))
    .pipe(gulp.dest("./_build/"));
});

```

This example sets up the task `juicepress` and the generated pages will contain the base URL *http://localhost:800/*

For a full list of supported options, please see <https://github.com/trenker/juicepress>

:bangbang: IMPORTANT: gulp-juicepress ignores the "buildDirectory" setting of juicepress. Instead you have to pipe the result to gulp.dest, pointing to a folder.

:bangbang: IMPORTANT: gulp-juicepress only works with buffers, not with streams. It will warn you though, if you pipe a stream to it.
